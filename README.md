<h3>2x2 Rubik's Cube Solver</h3>

<h4>How to use:</h4>
- A scrambled state is identified by a string where each letter represents the color of a sticker on the cube (see diagram)<br>
- The scrambled state is entered as a parameter for the solve method (located in the main method)<br>
- A solved cube with white on top would be entered as "wwwwggggrrrrooooyyyybbbb"<br><br>

w = white<br>
g = green<br>
r = red<br>
o = orange<br>
y = yellow<br>
b = blue<br><br>

Order in which to enter state:<br>

<h4>How it Works (the basics)</h4>
The program uses a graph to model a 2x2 Rubik's Cube, where each Vertex is a state that the cube can be in and each Edge is the move that would transition from one state to another. To generate this graph, we start with a solved cube. We then generate all of its neighbors by performing every possible move on it. From here, the cycle repeatsâ€“for each of the neighbors that was just generated, we find its neighbors, checking to make sure that the resulting state is not redundant (e.g. performing the moves R R' would result in a solved cube, but we already know that we can achieve a solved cube by applying no moves, so the R R' case is ignored). <br><br>

A couple tricks were used to conserve space. First, nodes only store (the node that they came from) and (their state). The states are stored as an array of bytes, which saves considerable space over ints. Additionally, no edges are actually stored because we only care about the path from a node back to the solved state, which we can generate by backtracking. The main space issue is that each state is stored 24 times; one for each of the cube's 24 possible orientations. To avoid this, we only use the use R B and D moves, which essentially locks the top left corner in place. We've still generated each possible state, but we've avoided redundancy as all states are relative to the top left corner, which is now fixed.
